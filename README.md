- **Load Patterns / Charger des motifs**:
  - Load predefined patterns from the patterns.txt file.

- **Set Pattern / D√©finir un motif**:
  - Set a new pattern or select an existing one.

- **Set Tolerance / D√©finir une tol√©rance**:
  - Set a similarity tolerance level for pattern matching.

- **Upload a CSV File / T√©l√©charger un fichier CSV**:
  - Upload a CSV file for similarity analysis.

- **Reset Tool / R√©initialiser l'outil**:
  - Reset the tool's statistics and results.

### Results 

After uploading a CSV file and initiating the analysis, you will see the following information on the dashboard:

- **Elements Tested / √âl√©ments test√©s**:
  - The total number of elements in the CSV file that were analyzed.

- **Last Element / Dernier √©l√©ment**:
  - The most recent element that was analyzed.

- **Last Score / Dernier score**:
  - The Jaro-Winkler similarity score of the last analyzed element.

- **Average Score / Score moyen**:
  - The average Jaro-Winkler similarity score of all analyzed elements.

- **Valid Count / Compteur valide**:
  - The number of elements with a similarity score higher than or equal to the set tolerance.

- **Invalid Count / Compteur invalide**:
  - The number of elements with a similarity score lower than the set tolerance.

### Export Results 

You can export the analysis results to a CSV file by clicking the "Export Results" button. The exported CSV file will contain a list of all elements and their similarity scores.

## Patterns 

Patterns are used for similarity analysis. You can load predefined patterns from the patterns.txt file or set new patterns through the application.

## Saving Patterns 

If you want to save patterns for future use, you can manually add them to the patterns.txt file in the following format:

```plaintext
Pattern Name 1 : Pattern
Pattern Name 2 : Pattern
Pattern Name 3 : Pattern
...
```

Each pattern should be on a separate line.

### Conclusion
LDCS - OpenFields Checker is a powerful tool for analyzing the similarity of elements in a CSV file to specific patterns. It can be useful for various data analysis and validation tasks.
